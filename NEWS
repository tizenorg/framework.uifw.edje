    * new interpolations: ACCEL_FAC, DECEL_FAC, SIN_FAC, DIVIS, BOUNCE, SPRING
    * "entry,paste,request,1" signal (primary)
    * "entry,paste,request,3" signal (clipboard)
    * "entry,selection,all,request" signal
    * "entry,selection,none,request" signal
    * "entry,paste,request*" signals afte cursor change
    * "entry,changed,user" signal
    * collection.group.limits.horizontal/vertical
    * input panel layout setting API's
    * edje_object_signal_callback_extra_data_get()
    * group inheritance and part re-ordering with inheritance
    * add change information to "entry,changed,user"
    * add "CURRENT" option for transitions to transition from current state
    * lua color/text class, map, text, image, line, polygon and edje object API's

Fixes:

    * invalid memory access in edje alias code
    * recusive aliases fixed
    * cursor didn't change on backspace signal
    * propagation of recursive events on existing part
    * box/table signal not including name correctly
    * clicked signal on entry
    * propagation of recursive events between existing and non-existing parts
    * textblock handling in size_min_restricted_calc fixed
    * stop emitting "cursor,changed" on text set
    * external usage in sub groups now have proper parents
    * ellipsis fixed with small text parts
    * edje_shutdown() fixed if called before all edje objects are gone
    * allow -1 for description.max

Improvements:

    * built-in epp (from e16) to replace cpp/gcc pre-processor on all platforms
    * edje_decc only uses edje_cc as compiler for security paranoia
    * use smart clipper more from evas
    * text.align now works for textblock too
    * creation/deletion of edje objects should be faster with freeze and thaws
    * don't walk eina_list when deleting member classes - faster
    * part.description.max now can define just 1 axis
    * signal and message propagation is more consistent and simpler now
