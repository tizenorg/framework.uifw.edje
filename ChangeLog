        1.0.0 release

2011-01-30  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added "UNDER" cursor mode.
        * Added auto-alignment to text parts, just set text.alignment to -1 to
          activate it. It's only relevant to TEXT parts, textblock objects
          already have that by default.

2011-02-01  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added Mirroring support to edje objects.

2011-02-08  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix invalid memory access by edje alias code.

2011-02-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix use of recursive alias.

2011-02-21  WooHyun Jung

        * Fix missing cursor changed signale on backspace

2011-02-21  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add built-in cpp (epp) to provide consistent output on all archs/OSes

2011-02-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Fix propagation of recursive events on existing part.

2011-02-24  Cedric BAIL

	* fix signal comming from box/table item to include their
	index or name correctly.

2011-02-25  Jihoon Kim

	* Add edje_object_part_text_cursor_pos_{set,get} API

2011-02-27  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * Added size_range property to TEXT parts in edje files.
	This lets you limit the size of the font that will be used.
	Especially useful when using fit.

2011-03-10  WooHyun Jung

        * Fix: Emit clicked signal on entry if still in - missing.

2011-03-10  Cedric BAIL

	* Correctly propagate recursive event with existing and non existing
	part.

2011-03-11  Cedric BAIL

	* Add PROXY part.

2011-03-19  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Change edje_decc to only use edje_cc as the compiler for security
        and correctness reasons.

2011-03-23  Brett Nash (nash)

	* Move some of edje over to use smart clipper in evas.  This _should_
	be transparent to users.

2011-03-30  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* text.align (only the vertical part) now works for textblock.

2011-04-1  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add Feature: Support explicit shadow direction with extra effect
        param (optional). Default as before.

2011-04-28  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

        * size_min_restricted_calc: Fixed textblock handling.

2011-05-15  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry - New API: added edje_object_part_text_append which appends
	   text to the end of the textblock part. This lets us do cool thing
	   like population of textblock using idler.

2011-05-16  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add new interpolation modes for programs to make animation
        much easier. Added: ACCEL_FAC, DECEL_FAC, SIN_FAC, DIVIS,
        BOUNCE, SPRING (also made short name versions of the long ones
        possible too).

2011-05-19  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry: Don't emit "cursor,changed" when setting the text, because
	   the cursor really didn't change, it's more like a new cursor.
	   Also, when setting position, don't do anything if position is as it
	   was.

2011-05-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Improve performance on create/delete of edje objects by using
        evas freeze and thaw calls. May help in certain pathological
        situations.

2011-05-27  Cedric Bail

	* Improve performance by avoiding walking eina_list for nothing
	when deleting member_class.

2011-06-09  Cedric Bail

	* Fix external usage in sub group to have the proper parents.

2011-06-11  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	  text parts.

2011-06-21  Cedric Bail

	* Make it possible to define part.description.max only on one axis.

2011-07-24  Mike Blumenkrantz

        * Add signals entry,paste,request,1 (PRIMARY) and entry,paste,request,3 (CLIPBOARD)
          to differentiate between paste types
        * Add entry,selection,all,request for signalling ctrl+a in an entry
        * Add entry,selection,none,request for signalling ctrl+shift+a in an entry
        * Fix entry,paste,request* to be emitted after cursor,changed (fixes middle mouse paste location)

2011-05-27  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Fix edje_shutdown() being called before all evas objects created
        by edje (edje objects) are gone. Delay internal core shutdown
        until all references gone.

2011-08-03  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Added changed,user signal. This signal indicates the entry
	has changed because of user interaction, i.e not by code.

2011-08-22  Cedric Bail

	* Add collection.group.limits {
	          vertical: "name" value;
	          horizontal: "name" value;
	      }.

2011-08-25  Jihoon Kim

	* Add entry input panel layout setting api's

2011-08-10  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Signals: Added the ability to pass extra data with edje signals.
	Added edje_object_signal_callback_extra_data_get to support that.

2011-08-29  Jaehwan Kim

	* Add group's inheritance.
	* Add insert_before, insert_after to can change the part's order.

2011-10-02  Boris Faure (billiob)

	* Fix edje_cc to accept -1 in description.max

2011-10-03  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Added change information to entry,changed,user

2011-11-03  Jaehwan Kim

	* Transition: Add the "CURRENT" option which causes the edje object move
	      from its current position.

2011-10-04  Govindaraju SM, Prince Kumar Dubey

	* Add Edje multisense that allows playback of samples and
          vibrator control and ultimately beginsd to pave the way for
          more complex audio etc. support.

2011-11-06  David Seikel (onefang)

	* Lua: Added color_class and text_class functions.
	    Still need to write a function for setting the classes of an object.
	    This works for things in OTHER groups using those classes though.
	* Add image, text, textblock (commented out), and edje objects.
	    Very basic support.
	* Add functions for set/get text font, size, and text.
	* Add function for set/get image image.
	    Still needs to limit to only imagess in the current edje file.
	* Add functions for set/get image fill and filled.
	* Add function for set/get edje file.
	    Still needs to limit to only groups in the current edje file.
	* Add full support for evas line object.
	* Add full support for evas polygon object.
	* Beefed up the example lua script to show most of the above.
	  Including some handling of size changes.
	* White space fixes, one of the editors I use cleans those up automatically.  shrugs

	* Lua: Added half of the evas map API.

2011-11-07  David Seikel (onefang)

        as well as simpler.

2011-12-02 Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        1.1.0 release

        * Fix potential crash from buffer overflow on copying map data.

2011-12-15  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Added support for various new key bindings:
	Ctrl+Arrows, Ctrl+Del and Ctrl+Backspace.
	* Entry: Added cursor,changed,manual signal.
	This signal indicates the cursor has been manually changed, i.e by
	either mouse click or arrows.

2012-01-02 Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

        * Fix prototype for edje_object_part_text_cursor_content_get()
          as it returned a strduped string and not an internal one, so
          this just formalizes its existing behavior correctly.

2012-01-03  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	* Entry: Fixed undo/redo with IMF.

2012-01-04  Carsten Haitzler (The Rasterman)

	* Add EDJE_ASPECT_PREFER_SOURCE.

2012-01-07  David Seikel (onefang)

	* Lua: Calling non exstent functions no longer crashes scripts.
	   This is so that future scripts will still work with old libraries,
	   and lets us add the "host can provide Lua API" feature soon.

2012-01-09  David Seikel (onefang)

	* Lua: Added edje.version().
